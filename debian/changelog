turtlebot-desktop (0.0.3) precise; urgency=low

  * First pass at adding mime support
  * added .debhelper files to gitignore
  * dh_installmime test

  * cdbs doesn't seem to be working correctly. Trying dh directly
  * Moved icons to hicolor instead of generating an entire new theme
  * Fixed permissions on desktop files, merged config and dashboard icons, updated launcher to include ROS launcher
